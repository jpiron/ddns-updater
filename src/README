DDNS Updater
============

The Dynamic DNS service allows you to alias a dynamic IP address to a static hostname, allowing your computer to be more easily accessed from various locations on the Internet.
 
This is a simple Python script to register your dynamic IP address using the NIC V2.0 protocol. An optional e-mail notification can be enabled.
